Foundation course on Embedded C programming using STM32 Microcontroller.

This is our new course mainly targeted for absolute beginners to learn microcontroller programming using the 'C ' programming language.

Please note that "Embedded C" is NOT a separate programming language. 'Embedded C' is rather embedded target aware programming using traditional 'C' programming language.

Some of the critical microcontroller-related 'C' concepts such as

Importance of bitwise operators

Usage of bit manipulation techniques to program MCU peripheral registers

accessing memory-mapped registers using pointers

pointers and casting

structures, bitfields, unions, and bit extraction techniques

representing hardware registers details and configuring them using 'C' structure definitions

Usage of const and volatile type qualifiers

Interpret complex variable definitions involving the combination of const and volatile

The precise usage of const pointers, const data, volatile const, with pointer and non-pointer variables

The behavior of the code during compiler optimization and solution using volatile

Functions and friends

Data types, variables definitions, storage class specifiers and much more

Loops: while, for, do. while

MCU internal architecture and programming peripherals

Interfacing projects

All these concepts are discussed with clear examples and writing code for the target embedded board.

According to 2017 embedded dot com survey still 'C' is one of the most widely used programming languages  for embedded code development

This course gives particular emphasis to learn 'C' programming concepts practically for microcontroller use cases.
